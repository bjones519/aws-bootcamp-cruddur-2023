# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

## Required Homework
 I got the frontend react page for notifications working
 ![frontend](assets/frontend.png)
 I got the backend notification endpoint working 
 ![backend](assets/backend-notif.png)

 I got the postgres container working
 ![postgres](assets/postgres.png)
 
 I got the dynamoDB container working
 ![dynamodb](assets/dynamodb.png)
 

## Homework Challenges
Link to the DockerHub repo that I pushed and tagged the images to: [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/bjones25/aws_bootcamp_2023_cruddur/tags)

I was able to install Docker locally and pulled down the images I pushed to DockerHub and get the containers running
![pull](assets/backend-dockerhub-pull.png)
![running](assets/backend%20container%20running.png)

I also got the front end container running but I think there is an issue with the communication between backend and frontend because the cruddur app loads but the feed is blank. Trouble shooting to see if I can get it working
